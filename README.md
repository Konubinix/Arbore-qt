Here shall appear a friend-to-friend filesharing app with the following caracteristics:
- targeted for private/low diffusion data between people that know each-others. Main use case: friends want to share between each-others their holidays pictures.
- low friction: it should be as easy as possible
- encryption should be used to maintain privacy and to control the diffusion of the data

This application will be build on top of [IPFS](http://ipfs.io/).
